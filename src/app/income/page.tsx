            ðŸ“ˆ Initial Investment
          </h2>
          <p>
            The cost to establish an electric vehicle charging station varies
            based on location and the number of chargers. Setting up a station
            typically ranges from Rs. 5-10 lakhs, with individual charging
            points costing between Rs. 50,000 to 1 lakh each. For a station with
            four charging points, the initial outlay might total Rs. 20-30
            lakhs.

            ðŸš— Potential for Profit
          </h2>
          <p>
            Imagine 100 electric vehicle owners who charge their vehicles daily
            at your station. This could lead to monthly revenues of
            approximately Rs. 4-5 lakhs. With a gross profit margin of about
            30%, you could make a monthly profit of Rs. 1.2-1.5 lakhs, which
            translates to a net income of Rs. 60,000-75,000.

            ðŸ“Š Revenue Breakdown
          </h2>
          <p>
            Consider a scenario where 100 EV owners use your station daily for 2
            hours each. Daily revenue could hit Rs. 10,000 (based on Rs. 100 per
            charge). This would amount to a monthly revenue of Rs. 3 lakhs. With
            a gross margin of 30%, profits could be around Rs. 90,000 per month,
            while net margins, after accounting for operating expenses of
            15-20%, might range between Rs. 45,000-60,000.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The electric vehicle charging sector offers remarkable scalability.
            Starting small, you can gradually add more chargers and expand to
            new locations or even consider franchising. The business model
            supports expansive growth, promising substantial scalability.
